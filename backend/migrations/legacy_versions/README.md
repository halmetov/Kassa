Legacy Alembic revisions retained for reference after resetting the migration history.
The previous graph failed to load because the merge revision `8ffb3c4c3d7c` expected
revision `1c42f6c52c1d`, which was removed in production deployments. New databases
should use the consolidated `ed4a5edbfa76_reset_initial_schema` head instead of these files.
